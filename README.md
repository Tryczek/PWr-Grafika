## Lab Projects

### Lab 2

**Objective:** Explore the basics of OpenGL and C++ programming for rendering simple graphics.

**Key Features:**
- **Coordinate System Setup:** Learn how to set up a basic coordinate system in OpenGL.
- **Simple Shapes:** Render basic shapes such as points and lines.
- **User Interaction:** Implement basic user interaction using keyboard and mouse events.

**Key Files:**
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main logic for rendering 3D objects using OpenGL. It sets up the coordinate system, handles user inputs, and renders shapes.
- `Glab2.exe`: Compiled executable for the project, allowing you to run the application directly.
- `Sprawozdanie.pdf`: Documentation file explaining the project details, including setup instructions, code explanations, and expected outcomes.

### Lab 3

**Objective:** Build on the concepts from Lab 2 by adding more complex graphical elements and user interaction.

**Key Features:**
- **3D Shapes:** Introduce 3D shapes such as cubes and spheres.
- **Camera Controls:** Implement basic camera controls to navigate around the 3D scene.
- **Dynamic Interaction:** Enhance user interaction with more complex events, such as rotating and zooming the view.

**Key Files:**
- `main.cpp`: Enhanced to include more advanced graphics and interaction. It adds 3D shape rendering and camera control functionalities.
- `Glab2.exe`: Updated executable with new features, reflecting the enhancements made in the source code.
- `Sprawozdanie.pdf`: Documentation explaining the new additions and features, providing detailed descriptions and usage instructions.

### Lab 4

**Objective:** Implement advanced techniques in OpenGL, including lighting and texture mapping.

**Key Features:**
- **Lighting:** Learn how to implement different lighting models, including ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.
- **Textures:** Apply textures to 3D objects to give them a more realistic appearance.
- **Advanced User Controls:** Introduce advanced user controls to manipulate the lighting and textures in real-time.

**Key Files:**
- `main.cpp`: Includes implementations for lighting and textures. It demonstrates how to apply different lighting models and textures to 3D objects.
- `Sprawozdanie.pdf`: Report detailing the methodologies and results of the lab project. It includes theoretical explanations, implementation details, and outcome analysis.

### Lab 5

**Objective:** Finalize the graphics project with comprehensive features, including complex models and interactive user interfaces.

**Key Features:**
- **Complex Models:** Render complex 3D models such as teapots and pyramids.
- **Interactive UI:** Develop an interactive user interface to control various aspects of the graphics application.
- **Comprehensive Integration:** Integrate all learned concepts into a single, comprehensive application.

**Key Files:**
- `main.cpp`: Final project code with complete features, integrating complex models and an interactive user interface.
- `Glab6.docx`: Project documentation, providing a detailed overview of the project, implementation steps, and user instructions.
- `Sprawozdanie.pdf`: Final report summarizing the project. It includes a comprehensive analysis of the project's goals, methodologies, and results.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the lab projects:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Lab Folder:**
   ```bash
   cd Lab2  # or Lab3, Lab4, Lab5
   ```

3. **Compile the Project:**
   Depending on your environment, use the provided `Makefile` or your preferred method to compile the `main.cpp` file.

4. **Run the Executable:**
   ```bash
   ./Glab2.exe  # Ensure you are in the correct directory and have the necessary permissions.
   ```

## Prerequisites

- **OpenGL**: Ensure you have OpenGL installed on your system.
- **GLUT**: The projects use the freeglut library. Ensure it is installed and correctly referenced in your development environment.
- **C++ Compiler**: A standard C++ compiler is required to compile the source code.

## Additional Resources

- **Documentation**: Each lab folder contains a PDF or DOCX file with detailed explanations of the lab objectives, methodology, and results.
- **Source Code**: The `main.cpp` file in each lab folder contains the primary source code for that lab's project.
